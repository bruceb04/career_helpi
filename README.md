Recently, we have made several updates to Career Helpi to improve both functionality and user experience. We have refined the descriptions throughout the platform to ensure they are more accurate and informative, providing users with clearer guidance and expectations. Additionally, we have made small but impactful styling changes to enhance the visual appeal and usability of the platform. For instance, we have ensured that buttons on the homepage are aligned and consistent in size, and we have centered important text elements to improve readability. These updates, along with the integration of ChatGPT results, make Career Helpi a more effective and user-friendly tool for career exploration.
